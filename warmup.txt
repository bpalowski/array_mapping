What is a callback function? How is it different from a plain ol' everyday function?
-A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function 
to complete some kind of routine or action.

What portion of the following code is the callback function? What does this 
particular callback function do? var tripledNumbers = numbers.map(function(number) {
return number * 3;
});
-number is the callback function. number is multiplied by 3.

Does map() alter the array it is called upon?
-the map method does not mutate the array on which it is called. The callback function can.

Discuss with your partner when you use forEach() and when it might be better to use
map()?
-Whenever a new array needs to be created with its resuts of being called on a function of every element.

(map description map calls a provided callback function once for each element in an array, in order, and constructs a new array from the results. callback is invoked only for indexes of the array which have assigned values, including undefined.)
